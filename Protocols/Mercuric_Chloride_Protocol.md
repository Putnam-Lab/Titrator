1. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
  - 250 mL Pyrex bottle with lid
  - 200 mL DI Water
  - 7g powdered HgCl2
  - Scoopula (labeled with sharpie "Toxic-Mercuric Chloride")
  - Scale
  - Baby pads/lining

  - Tape
  - Ziplock bags
  
2. <a name="Pre-Setup"></a> **Pre-Setup**
  1. HgCl2(s) is highly toxic when inhaled, ingested, or absorbed by skin.
  1. Lab coat, nitrile examination gloves, safety goggles, and Maintenance-Free Respirator are required.
  1. Work in the fume hood at all times with the fan turned on and guard lowered to the appropriate level.
  
3. <a name="Weighing_HgCl2"></a> **Weighing_HgCl2**
  1. Line the scale with baby pads or other lining.
    1. It's helpful to line any surface that may be touched or affected by HgCl2.
  1. Put stir bar inside the pyrex bottle and place the bottle on the scale without lid and tare.
  1. Fill a clean beaker with 200mL DI water and place near the scale
  1. Using the scoopula, carefully weigh out 7g of HgCl2 into the bottle, being careful to not spill the powder during the transfer.
  1. Pour the 200mL DI water carefully into the bottle and close the lid on the bottle.
  
4. <a name="Mixing_HgCl2"></a> **Mixing_HgCl2**
  1. Line the stir plate with baby pads or other lining.
  1. Transfer the bottle to the stir plate and turn on high
  1. Leave bottle in the fume hood to mix until all solid is dissolved (at least 1 hour)
  
5. <a name="Clean_Up"></a> **Clean_Up**
  1. Wrap bottle in aluminum foil and wrap lid with parafilm
  1. Label bottle as "Toxic - 50% Saturated Mercuric Chloride HgCl2"
  1. Tape a centrifuge tube to the side of the bottle (for pipette drippings during use)
  1. Place in appropriate secondary storage container and cabinet labeled "Toxic"
  1. Dry-wipe the scoopula to clean off as much HgCl2 powder as possible and store in a sealable ziplock bag labeled "Toxic - Mercuric Chloride"
  1. In another ziplock bag labeled "Toxic Waste - Mercuric Chloride", dispose of all liners, kim wipes, gloves, and all other waste items that came in contact with Mercuric Chloride.
    1. Place the waste bag in appropriate secondary storage (or contact waste management for removal if there is a large amount of waste)
