1. **Setting up the Balance**
	1. Turn on Analytical Balance by plugging in the black cord into the small circular slot at the back of the balance. The balance "ON/OFF" button is currently not working.

2. **Measuring with the Balance**
	1. Using an empty 80 ml Cup place the cup in the balance and wait until the weight stabilizes 
		1. Slide open the glass on either side of the balance.
	2. Press “→T←” to “Zero” the balance.
	3. Fill 60g of seawater
		1. (Optional: For beginners, it’s recommended to use a 100mL beaker or graduated cylinder to gain knowledge of the approximation of the cup) 
	4. Place the liquid filled cup into the balance, to receive a measurement.
		1. Precision: ± 0.0001g 
        5. Record the measurement for weight of each specific sample in a notebook or Excel data sheet to transfer to the LabX program before starting your titration.

3. **Clean up**
	1. Discard liquid into sink, unless it has an acid or CRM inside. Place the waste into the correctly labeled waste bottle in the cabniet to the left of the titrator.
	2. Rinse cup with Type I DI water.
	3. Place cups on a kimwipe next to the titrator. 
	4. Save the data from Excel to the “Documents” folder.
	5. Shut off the Balance by unplugging the balancer.
