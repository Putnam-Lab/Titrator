1. <a name="Pre-Setup"></a> **Pre-Setup**
	1. Since you are working with HCl. Lab Coat, Examination Gloves, and Safety Goggles are always required.
	1. The fume hood fan must be turned on. 
2. <a name="Prep_Acid_Solution"></a> **Prep Acid Solution**
	1. Measure out 9L of DI water in the appropriate container (marked for 10% HCl in DI)
		1. **always pour water before acid into your container**
	1. Turn on the fume fan before handing HCl and open the bib no further than the indicator arrow on the side of the hood.
	1. Under the fume hood, carefully pour the necessary amount of HCl into container to reach a 10% solution by volume (1L HCl). Be careful to not splash.
3. <a name="Setup_the_bath"></a> **Setup the bath**
	1. The fan from the fume hood must be on whenever the lid from the acid bath is open.
		  1. Shut the lid when not in use.
	1. In a second clean container, fill with the same volume or more of DI water only (~10-12L)
4. <a name="Acid_Wash"></a> **Acid Wash**
    	1. Remove any labels from bottles before washing.
	1. Carefully place the bottles and caps, separated, into the bath 
           1. Submerge the items as much as possible.  The acid can't clean what it's not in contact with.
	1. Shut the lid and let soak for 24 hours.
	1. Using a set of tongs, remove the bottles from the acid bath, carefully shake off any excess liquid, then place them in the DI-only bath.
	1. Shut the lid for the water bath and soak 24 hours.
	1. Shut the fume hood bib when not in use.
5. <a name="Drying"></a> **Drying**
	1. Gather the bottles from the water bath and place them onto a clean drying mat, with the head in direct contact into the mat.
	1. Once dry, close the bottles with their washed lids and store in a clean place until use.
6. <a name="Reuse_and_Disposal"></a> **Reuse and Disposal**
	1. Once prepared, the acid bath can be used for multiple washes.  Use litmus paper to check pH before adding new items to the bath.  If pH < 1, the bath can be used for another wash.
	1. The DI water bath can only be used for 2-3 washes.  Use litmus paper to check pH before adding new items to the bath.  If pH ~ 6-7, the bath can be used for another wash.
	1. If pH falls out of those parameters for the acid bath or DI bath, the solution must be neutralized and then disposed of.  
	1. To neutralize the acid, pour baking soda little by little into the solution and carefully stir with a glass stir bar to dissolve the sodium bicarbonate solid.  Test pH with litmus, and if pH < 7 continue to add baking soda and test with litmus until pH reaches 7.  At pH=7 the solution is neutral water with dissolved salts and can be poured down the sink. 
	1. Run the faucet briefly after pouring, to rinse off the remaining salt water from the sink basin.  Rince the bin with DI before using again.
